            <h2>The UC InTTO traces its origins to June 2021</h2>
            <p>
            when it was established as an integral part of the University following the successful implementation of two key projects:
            the DOST-HEIRIT Project Grant for the Establishment of the UC Innovation and Nurturing Space (UCIANS) and the DOST IMPACT
            Program Grant for the Establishment of the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Office of the University of the Cordilleras (KTTO).<br><br>

            These initiatives, concluded in June 2021 and April 2022, respectively, laid the foundation for InTTO's mission to become a
            pivotal player in the country's innovation ecosystem. Operating under the Office of the Vice President of Research, Innovation
            and Institutional Planning, InTTO aims to foster disruptive and innovative ideas, incubate promising concepts, and facilitate
            intellectual property protection and technology transfer opportunities to address societal challenges effectively. This mission
            is realized through its two subunits: the UC Innovation and Nurturing Space and the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Office.
